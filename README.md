### Introduction
Lab2 consists of 3 exercises. In [exercise 1](./naivecoin_1/), you will learn how to implement a basic blockchain, understand the basic definitions of blocks, blockchain, and nodes. In [exercise 2](./naivecoin_2/), you will build on [exercise 1](./naivecoin_1/) by implementing the proof of work algorithm and validating the blockchain. In [exercise 3](./naivecoin_3/), you will implement basic transactions and transaction mining.


### Quick Start
```sh
#
cd naivecoin_1 
# run main code 
npm run-script main
# clean the local database
npm run-script clean
```
